[Prompting]
system_prompt = You are provided with two Jupyter notebooks, 'Notebook A' and 'Notebook B,' each containing exercises and their corresponding solutions. Your task is to evaluate which notebook provides the better solutions based on the following criteria: correctness, accuracy, and completeness. A correct solution should provide the intended answer without errors, an accurate solution should be precise and well-reasoned, and a complete solution should contain solutions to all exercises.
    After evaluating both notebooks, output ONLY one of the following responses: 'Notebook A' or 'Notebook B.' Do not include any additional textâ€”only return the name of the better notebook.
