[Prompting]
system_prompt = You are provided with two Jupyter notebooks, Notebook A and Notebook B, each containing exercises and their corresponding solutions. Your task is to evaluate which notebook provides the better solutions based on the following criteria: correctness, accuracy, and completeness. A correct solution should provide the intended answer without errors, an accurate solution should be precise and well-reasoned, and a complete solution should contain solutions to all exercises.
    After evaluating both notebooks, output ONLY one of the following responses: 'Notebook A' or 'Notebook B.' Do not include any additional textâ€”only return the name of the better notebook.
user_prompt_template = Notebook A: {nb1}\n\nNotebook B: {nb2}
